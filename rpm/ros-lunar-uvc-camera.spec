%description
A collection of node(let)s that stream images from USB cameras (UVC) and provide
CameraInfo messages to consumers. Includes a two-camera node that provides rough
synchronization for stereo vision. Currently uses the base driver from Morgan
Quigley's uvc_cam package.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
